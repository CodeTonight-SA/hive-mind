# Hive Mind

A cooperative puzzle game for teams. Save the Queen together.

## Concept

Two players work together to guide the Queen bee to safety:
- **Forager** can slide pieces
- **Architect** can rotate pieces

Neither can solve the puzzle alone. Coordination is everything.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Each player chooses a role (Forager or Architect)
3. Work together to get the Queen (👑) to the exit
4. Goal: Solve in minimum moves

### Controls

**Forager:**
- Click a piece to select it
- Use arrow keys (or WASD) to slide

**Architect:**
- Click a piece to rotate it 90°

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- No build step required
- Mobile-friendly (responsive)
